# Advertising

### Some people say that advertising encourages us to buy things we really do not need. Others say that advertisements tell us about new products that may improve our lives. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.


1.	正：举例：顾客可以通过广告了解新产品的特性和功能；
2.	正：对比：有广告→有更多的选择；没广告→选择少；
3.	反：即使广告可能诱导顾客消费，是因为顾客没有抵挡住诱惑，可以从个人层面避免。


自上个世纪初到现在的约十年中，是中国营销传播发展最快的阶段，而广告在其中扮演了非常重要角色。然而，人们对广告的影响和意义却存在着分歧。我认为，广告的出现可以提升我们的生活品质。

首先，产品的制造者通过广告的形式可以让消费者了解自己新产品的特性和功能。例如在某个油烟机的广告中，厂家宣传了该机器独创的双风道设计，可以快速排出有害油烟；又比如一款感冒药“白加黑”，其广告口号“治疗感冒，黑白分明”，传播的核心信息是“白天服白片，不瞌睡；晚上服黑片，睡得香”。

其次，广告的出现可以让消费者拥有更多的选择。在互联网购物没有那么发达的时候，广告仅仅投放在电视、路旁等，投放数量很有限，公众了解到的产品也同样有限，导致一些新兴的、不同种类的产品无法被大众知悉；互联网购物大量普及之后，民众可以从各大手机应用程序上获得广告推送，也能看到大量的直播带货。消费者的选择变的多样化起来。

然而，很多人担心广告可能诱导顾客消费，导致用户购买了大量不需要的东西。我的评价是，消费者应该能够控制自己的消费欲望，养成良好的消费观念，不应该把责任全部归咎于广告的投放。但是那些导向过于明显的广告，例如大声、重复性给消费者洗脑的广告应该被管制。

总而言之，我坚信广告能够改善我们的生活。不过对于那些容易诱导消费者冲动消费的广告，有关部门应该出台相应政策去约束广告制作者，并引导消费者理性消费。

The beginning of the last century to the last decade is the period that the most development of China’s marketing and promotion. In that stage, advertisements played important roles in enhancing customers’ expenditure. However, there are many differences of opinion among the public. From my point of view, I think advertisements could improve our quality of life.

First and foremost, by using the ad, producers can give relative information to customers and let them know about new products' functions and features. There is an ad example of a new type of range hood. The ad maker illustrated the unique design of the dual exhaust duct to absorb harmful fumes much more quickly than other brands’ items. Another example is a cold medicine called "white plus black", which has an advertising slogan of "treating colds with clear black and white", and the core message conveyed is "taking white tablets during the day, not drowsy; taking black tablets at night, sleeping soundly".

Next, the application of ads could make the public more choices. In a time when the Internet was not developed like now, ads are only placed on television and the roadside and it amount was very small. In that situation, there was a limitation for people knowing different goods. After the widely spread of the Internet, the public could be acquired ad recommendations from live streams as well as various apps. Consumers' choices have become more diverse.

Nevertheless, there are many people concerned about the problem that ads may induce customer consumption to buy something needn’t. I assess that people should control their aspirations of buying and cultivate a good consumption mindset, which should not be solely attributed to advertising placement. But the ads that are too clearly oriented, such as loud and repetitive ads that brainwash consumers, should be regulated.

In conclusion, I still consist that ads could benefit our life. But for ads that can easily induce consumers to consume impulsively, relevant departments should introduce corresponding policies to restrain advertising producers and guide consumers to consume rationally.

The period spanning from the beginning of the last century to the previous decade marked a phase of significant growth in China's marketing and promotional endeavours. During this era, advertisements assumed pivotal roles in stimulating consumer spending. However, varying opinions pervade the public discourse on this matter. From my standpoint, I am inclined to believe that advertisements hold the potential to enhance our quality of life.

Foremost, advertising empowers producers to furnish pertinent information to customers, acquainting them with the functionalities and attributes of novel products. An illustrative example is the advertisement for a novel type of range hood. The creators of the advertisement elucidated the distinctive design of the dual exhaust duct, which rapidly eliminates noxious fumes more efficiently than rival brands. Another instance is a cold medication named "white plus black," accompanied by the slogan "treating colds with clear black and white." The core message conveys that the white tablets, consumed during the day, induce wakefulness, while the black tablets, ingested at night, promote sound sleep.

Furthermore, the utilization of advertisements expands the array of choices accessible to the general public. In times when the Internet was not as developed as it is today, advertisements were primarily confined to television and roadside displays, constituting a relatively modest presence. This limited people's exposure to diverse products. With the widespread proliferation of the Internet, individuals now acquire advertising recommendations through live streams and various applications, thus diversifying consumer options significantly.

Nevertheless, concerns persist regarding the potential of advertisements to impel needless consumer expenditures. I contend that individuals should exercise self-control over their purchasing impulses and nurture a judicious consumption mindset. This concern cannot be solely ascribed to advertising placements. However, advertisements that are overtly persuasive, like overly loud and repetitious ones that potentially influence consumer decisions through relentless repetition, ought to be subjected to regulation.

In summary, I remain steadfast in my belief that advertisements can be beneficial to our lives. Nonetheless, advertisements that have the potential to encourage impulsive consumption warrant consideration. Relevant authorities should formulate appropriate policies to regulate advertising practices and guide consumers toward rational consumption patterns.
